The algorithms presented here are described in: 
"Presentation of microstructural diffusion components by color schemes in abdominal organs" in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 
Article DOI: 10.1002/mrm.30183

C++ code to create RGB diffusion component maps is provided with cmake.
As RGBtri software handles with Nifti images, the only dependency is Nifti package: https://github.com/NIFTI-Imaging/nifti_clib
